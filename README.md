# MATLAB Matrix Operations

This repository contains MATLAB code to perform matrix operations including:
- Determinant
- Inverse (if invertible)
- Eigenvalues
- Plotting eigenvalues in the complex plane

## How to Use:
1. Save the `matrix_operations.m` file to your local machine.
2. Run it in MATLAB with a matrix input like so:
   ```matlab
   A = [4, 2, 1; 3, 5, 7; 1, 2, 6];
   matrix_operations(A);
